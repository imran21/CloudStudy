Step 1: Edit Configtx.yaml, orderer-peer-crypto-config.yaml and order.yaml (These files are outside orderer dir)
Step 2: Get into orderer dir 
		Step 1: ./clean all -> clean all the existing directory
		Step 2: ./init all -> Get the above file inside and create acme-channel.tx, acme-genesis.block
		Step 3: ./launch  -> Launch the orderer

Step 3: Now move to the peer directory
		Step 1: for cleaning the ledgerdata and all file execute "./clean all" command
		Step 2: execute .env.sh
		Step 2:./peer_init.sh -> create all the peer supporting files and start the peer node.
		 The Above 'pper_init.sh'  do the list of following. 
		 Stpe 1: >peer channel create -o localhost:7050 -c acmechannel -f ../orderer/acme-channel.tx
				  #-c -> any channel name eg;Apollo,Hundai
				  #-f -> channel transcation file created during orderer init
		 Step 2: > peer node start &
		 step 3: > peer channel join -o localhost:7050 -b acmechannel.block
					# -b <channelName.block> The .block file is created on above step 1(channel create)
		 step4: > peer channel list
				 To Check if the channel is created and listed
		 
Section 9 V 44
If peer in another organization-Org2 is wish to join the network the we need to use the genesis block of Org1.
For this we need to use fetch command and join command
This section is clearly mentioned in document section 9


		
		To Fetch data from 
		
		step 1: peer channel fetch 0 -o localhost:7050  -c acmechannel  acmechannel.block
		
		NOTE: if you want to start the peer with the specific identity you use set.identity.user1.sh script
			  Script available in Hyperledger\udemyDocuments\peer\simple-two-org
			  Explained in Section:9 v:41

Peer Channel

Its used to set the channel for the peer 
it has 7 commands the 
	- Create	-> Create the Channel on the network
	- Join		-> Peer join the specified channel
	- List		-> List the channel that peer has joined
	- fetch		-> This commad performs operation on orderer to fetch a block
	- getinfo	-> Get information on the specified channel
	- signconfigtx	-> For signing the config transcation file
	- update	-> update the existing channel config
	

To Initiate the peer do the following
File configurations are all already explained peer.txt

For creating and starting up the peer channel please go through peer/init.sh

The blockchain is composed of many peers
To make the other peers join to the channel we need to use the fetch command and join command.
The other option along with fetch command is 
		newest
		oldest
		blocknumber
		config

> peer channel fetch <any above 4 options>  -c ChannelID -o <ordererVM-IP:7050>

NOTE :: NOTE --> This fetch command is executed in orderer by specifing -o flag

We can provide the outfile name which is optional. If not providing the output filename then we will get file names as
channelID_newest.block, channelID_oldest.block, channelID_config.block, channelID_Blocknumber.block

Try Command peer node
> peer channel fetch config -c acmechannel -o <ordererVM-IP:7050> # to fect the config block in name channelID_config.block
	The fetch config is used to get config and make changes to the blockchain network
	The Admin will make changes to the config filesystem 
	Based on Policies one or more user will sign the configuration
	And admin submit the configuration to the blockchain network

> peer channel fetch 0 -c acmechannel -o <ordererVM-IP:7050> # to fect the config block in name channelID_0.block (Genesis-block)

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\-
peer channel getinfo --flag

This getinfo commad is used to get the channel info from local blockchain
It retrives channel info like current hight, block hashes
peer channel getinfo -c <CannelID>

Try Command peer node
> peer channel getinfo -c acmechannel

How to update the network configuration in peer. For that the below commands are used.
	signconfigtx and  update.

				Before that "fetch" command is used to fetch the config file
											|
											|
											|
Then the config file is modified and new transcation file is created. To do this "configxlator" is used
The Updated configuration transcation file is then send to administrator of other organization
This one or mode admin has to sign and approve the transcation file based on the policy
											|
											|
											|
This Admin uses the "peer channel signconfigtx" commad to sign the modified config transcation
Then one of the admin will update the transcation to the network through the following command
								peer channel update


Signconfigtx command
peer channel  signconfigtx -f transcationFile

The peer update command enables the admin to submit the administraction transcation to the orderer
peer channel update  -f <transcation-file> -c channelID -o ordererURL


Step 1: on Orderer node use configtxgen to generate Anchor Peer update transcation channel
		> configtxgen -outputAnchorPeersUpdate Org1Anchors.tx -profile AcmeChannel -channelID acmechannel -asOrg Org1Anchors
		
Step 2: Copy the above(step 1) generated file to peer subfolder(may be on subfolder present in peer VM)
step 3: Use singconfigtx command to sign the transcation file
step 4: To verifi that file has been modified, check the file size before and after signconfigtx command
step 5: Now use the update command to submit the transcation to the network
Step 6: To check if config is updated or not we can the height of the block using "peer channel getinfo" command

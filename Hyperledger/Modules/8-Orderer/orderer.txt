Orderer
Section-8 v-30,31,32
References: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/main/sampleconfig/orderer.yaml
It is a single binary file
Orderer requires the genesis block for initilization
once it is initialized it will search for orderer.yaml file and should have access ordererMSP
The orderer.yaml file is mentioned using env variable FABRIC_CFG_PATH

Ordere writes log message to stderr
Log specification is set through env variable FABRIC_LOGGING_SPEC
FATAL|PANIC|ERROR|WARNING|INFO|DEBUG

Format for Log message is configured in env variable
FABRIC_LOGGING_FORMAT

On successful orderer implementation it will write data to ledger which is in the FileSystem
It uses GRPC service to communicat to client and peers

in orderer.yaml file the following parameters has to be considered.

Point 1: Under FileLedger section,
		 The location of the ledger sould be specified
		 Location: ./ledger
		 
		 If the ledger location is specified by us then  Prefix: should be disabled by commenting.

Point 2: 1. Under General section
			Disable "LedgerType"
		 
		 2. change 
			GenesisMethod: file
			GenesisFile: ./acme-genesis.block
		  
			to 
			BootstrapMethod: file
			BootstrapFile: ./acme-genesis.block
		  
			If you want to start the orderer with the system channel then location of the Genesis-block should be provided.
			As shown above.
		  
			If want to start orderer without system channel then set 
			BootstrapMethod: none
			and disable BootstrapFile

Orderer CSP configuration on orderer.yaml file
CSP and MSP configuration
BCCSP- Blockchain crypto service provider
	   support HardwareCSP(PKCS11) and softwareCSP(SW)
	   It is configured under BCCSP subsection.
	   Note: BCCP setup must be consistent accross the network.
	   
MSP - Need to set LocalMSPID and LocalMSPDir
     LocalMSPID - generated during configtxtgen 
	 LocalMSPDir -./crypto-config/ordererOrganizations/acme.com/orderers/orderer.acme.com/msp

Orderer configuration for gRPC and TSL certificate configuration

We will learn how to support Listerner interface parameter  and TSL transport

The order need to be setup for accepting connections from peers

we can download metric-server from GIT  and deploy as pod.
Once the metric-server pod is deployed we can use the follwoing command to get metric details
git clone metric-server.git
kubectl crete -f .
>kubectl top node  // to get cpu and memory usage of node
>kubectl top pod // to get CPU and memory usage of POD

To view the logs of the POD
>kubectl logs -f <POD-NAME>  //-f to stream pods continiously

If there is more containers in PODS and to view the Logs of that container we should provide the container name 
>kubectl logs -f <POD-NAME>  <Container-name>

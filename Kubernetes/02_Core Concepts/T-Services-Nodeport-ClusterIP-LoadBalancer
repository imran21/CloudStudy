Service Types
	1. Node port -> communication to pod through the node IP
	2. Cluster IP -> It will create a virtual IP in the cluster and enable communication to other pods
	3. Load balancer -> supported by the cloud provider
	
	

Node Port Spec details

TargetPort -> port running on the POD/container
port -> This refer to the port on the service itself
NodePort->This is the outside port which the user will use it from outside world 
			NOTE 1: Default node port range should be between 32000 to 32767
			NOTE 2: We can have multiple port mapping in single spec service

If we have multiple pod on same port on differnet Node, Then, we can use same service for multiple pod on different node.
			
			
			
			
Creating the service
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
   - targetPort: 80
     port: 80
	 nodePort: 30008
  selector:
     app: RC-template //this has too be labels from metadata of pod or replicaSet
     dep: Finance-Dep //myapp-RC //this has too be labels from metadata of pod or replicaSet
	 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cluster IP
If a group of frountend pod has to communicate to group of backend pod of same kind then we can use cluster IP
yaml file for cluster IP below. NOTE: This does not involve node port as it is for making comuunication between frontend to backend (Internal Traffic)
>kubectl get service -> This gives the Cluster IP through which we can communicate

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
   - targetPort: 80
     port: 80
  selector:
     app: RC-template //this has too be labels from metadata of pod or replicaSet
     dep: Finance-Dep //myapp-RC //this has too be labels from metadata of pod or replicaSet

Loadbalancer IP


Creating the service
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
   - targetPort: 80
     port: 80
	 nodePort: 30008
  selector:
     app: RC-template //this has too be labels from metadata of pod or replicaSet
     dep: Finance-Dep //myapp-RC //this has too be labels from metadata of pod or replicaSet

The scheduler is to schedule the pods to the specific nodes.

Plain EC2 machine
If we are using plain ec2 machine as kuberentes cluster we can nodeName
This is done by giving the "nodeName" key in the yaml file definition

If you are using Google cluster then
use 'nodeSelector'
First lable the node then use the nodeSelector key map the values 
Assigning the labes to the node is explained in different file "kubectl-node-cmd.txt"

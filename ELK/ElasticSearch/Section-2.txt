Shards and Replication.
Each index will have default one shards


To Increase te shards use Split API
To reduse the shards use Shrink API

----------------------------------------
Replication
If any node fails we can use replication to make copy of your index on multiple nodes
The shard that has been replicated is called "primary shard"
The primary shards and its replica shards are refered to as replication group

Each Shards will have an replication as explained in section-2 video-14 5:24 Time

Snapshots
Elasticsearch support taking snapshorts
Snapshots 

----------------------
Oncreating index, the status of index is yellow. 
The reason for this is, the index is having replica shards and this shards is not allocated to any node.
When we add new node then the replica will be placed in that node and it will be in green color.
As of now, yellow indicates that the status of  node is in warning stage.

-----------------------------------------
Adding New node the cluster

Step 1: Download elastic search on another dir if it is in same node(VM)
Step 2: go to elasticsearch.yml file and change and uncomment  "node.name: node-2"

Node Roles Section: 2 Chapter 17
	1. Master-eligible
		The node may be elected as cluster's master node
		 node.master: true|false
	2. Data
		As name implies, Enables the node to store data
		This involves storing data and performing search queries related to that data suc as search queries
		A node will not store any shards if this is disabled.
		This is best used when you have dedicated master node and data node
		node.data: true|false
	3. Ingest
		This enable the node to run the ingest pipeline
		The ingest pipeline are serious of steps(Process) that are performed when indexing documents
			Ie; process means manipulating document, resolving IP to lat/lan
		node.ingest: true|false
		
	4. Machine Learning
		If you wana to run a ML jobs on nodes you can set or tag the node as ML so that it will only run  ML jobs.
		Because of this, it will not affect the oter node job.
		
		node.ml -> identifies node as a machine learning node
			node.ml: true|false
		xpack.ml.enabled -> enables or disables the machine learning APIfor the node
			xpack.m1.enabled: true|false
	
	5. Cordination VTL-6:52
		This cordination refers to the distrubution of queries and aggrigation of results
		It used for large cluster
		Configuring by disabling all the roles
		
	6. Voting-only (Rarely used and almost we won't use it either)
		This role is used to select/elect the master
		This is mostly used in large cluster
		
		
To view Node roles
GET /_cat/nodes?v
And the _cat/nodes page 46 shows the codes.

node.role, r, role, nodeRole
(Default) Roles of the node -> cdfhilmrstw
Returned values include c (cold node), d (data node), f (frozen node), h (hot node), 
i (ingest node), l (machine learning node), m (master-eligible node), r (remote cluster client node), s (content node), t (transform node), v (voting-only node), w (warm node), and - (coordinating node only).

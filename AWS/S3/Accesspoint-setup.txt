AWS S3 access point

Reference: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/managing-amazon-s3-access-with-vpc-endpoints-and-s3-access-points/

This is to provide different set of permissions to the S3 bucket.
Like Dev-team to ave some set of permissions, App-team to have someset of permissions
This Provide only the Object level permission and not the bucket level permissions.
It is used along with the VPC endpoint.

Creating an AccessPoint with VPC
Step 1: select the bucket
Step 2: Go to access point tab
Step 3: Create AccessPoint
Step 4: select VPC
Step 5: Provide
		Accesspoint name
		VPC-ID
		Select "block all public access"
Step 6: Save

Create an Endpoint
Step 1: select VPC from AWS console
Step 2: Select Endpoint->Create Endpoint
Step 3: under catagory ,select
		Service category -> AWS service,
		Service Name -> s3-Gateway
		Select VPC
		Select RouteTable (pvt rtb)	
		policy-> Full Access or custom 
		(For custom policy for s3 access point please refer above document refrence-1)
		(I added policy only on endpoints and not on s3 bucket policy and it worked good)
Step 5: save

To validate go to the respective routetable and see if there is an Endpoint entry in it.
aws s3api get-object --key iplist --bucket arn:aws:s3:us-east-1:120763833592:accesspoint/apt90-cob-prod iplist
use the below cli command to validate

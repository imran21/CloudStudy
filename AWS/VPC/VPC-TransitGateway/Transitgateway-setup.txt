Transitgateway setup Video 46 and 47
IMPORTANT NOTE -> Transitgateway make communication only on the same AZ
			      Example: if VPC-1-pvt-VM-1 is on us-east-2b then VPC-2-pvt-VM-1 should be also in the same AZ ie; us-east-2b (Video-48)
				  
				  

If we need tomake communication among different VPC then we have to use the transitgateway.
VPC pearing  works only beetween one VPC to anoter VPC, But Transitgateway works among n number of VPC

Prerequisite: create 2 VPC  and 2 pvt subnet and 2 public subnet.
Goal: Make two private VPC communicate eachother through Trnasit gateway

Steps for implementing Transitgateway
Step A1: Creating Transitgateway
		Step 1: Create an  transit gateway
				Name -> Transitgateway name
				Enable 	DNS supportInfo
				Enable		VPN ECMP supportInfo
				Disable		Default route table associationInfo -> if automatically create route table association (Not Recomended, will create by own)
				Disbale		Default route table propagation -> if automatically create propogation (Not Recomended, will create by own)
		Step 2: Click Create Transitgateway

Step B1: Create Transit gateway attachement -> This is to attach each VPC to transitgateway

		Step 1: Create Transit gateway attachement  provide name 
		Step 2: Select transitgateway ID created in step A1
		Step 3: Select the respective VPC then create attachement
	Please do step B1 for each VPC

Step C1:  Create Transit gateway routetable -> This is same as VPC-subnet-routetable configuration but with additional configuration
		Step 1: Click Create Transit gateway routetable and provide name
		Step 2: select transitgatewayID as created in Step A1
		Step 3: Then click-on create Transit gateway route table
	    Step 4: Now go to the routetable and select association tab
				Now select the attachement that need to be associated to this routetable
				Best Practice - 1 attachement to 1 route table -> This is like how you associate subnet to route table in VPC
		Step 5: Now go to propogations tab and add respective tgw-attachement to which the particular VPC want to make communication.
				Example: If VPC-A want to communicate only to VPC-D and VPC-E and not to VPC-B and VPC-C then 
				 Select the VPC-A route table and add VPC-D and VPC-E tgw-attachement to the propogation.
			    Now The route entries will automatically updated in the route tab which has been taken from the VPC-CIDR.
				This will make any subnet added to the VPC could able to communicate with other VPC as per propogation.
				To avoid this, we can use the static route in the route table.
				CIDR -> VPC1-CIDR
				Choose Attachement -> VPC1-AttID
				
				
Step D1: Modify the VPC-subnet-routetable to communicate to transitgateway Asusual we do in VPC

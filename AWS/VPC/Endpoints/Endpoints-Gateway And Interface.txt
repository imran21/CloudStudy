Endpoint
Interface Endpoint 
	-> Will have an seprate ENI(IP , Security group)
	-> heavy management 
	-> use by lot of AWS resources.
	
Gateway Endpoint  ==> Mostly  used
	-> Less management 
	->used by only s3 and dynamoDB
	->No secgroup and IP address

Gateway Endpoint
	The setup is straing forward
	Create end point,attach to vpc and specific routet table.
	
Interface Endpoint
	It support wide varity of resources in AWS
	Create an Interface End point(in this example we have selected EC2)
	Attach to the subnet where the Ec2 machine needs to connect to another EC2 resources.
	Attach the secuity group to the endpoint and allow AllTraffic from the respective SecuityGroup(on source column attach the SecurityGroup whcih is attached to the pvt EC2 machine)
    
	Validation
	To check the connectivity of the endpoint try the followings
	Login to the private machine and execute the command
	>aws ec2 describe-instances
			OR
	>aws ec2 describe-instances --endpoint-url vpce-0feb69cbb5fc686d9-vshfprb5.ec2.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com
	
	This above command will provide you the output
	If it is not providing the output then there is a problem with the security group.
	
	If you wan to connect the private instance to the RDS the attach the RDS endpoint and follow the same steps above
	And to validate the rds enpoint connectivity try the below command once connecting to the RDS
	>aws rds describe-db-instances
	

Once Interface endpoint is created you will be getting the following DNS name. I have exaplined that one on eachthing below after //

vpce-0feb69cbb5fc686d9-vshfprb5.ec2.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com (Z7HUB22UULQXV) // Regional VPC Endpoint DNS hostname // This endpoint is used along with CLI --endpoint-url
vpce-0feb69cbb5fc686d9-vshfprb5-us-east-1b.ec2.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com (Z7HUB22UULQXV) //ZONAL DNS hostname for VPC endpoint
ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (Z004810515X9PC5THQ0LB)  // Default DNS hostname of the EC2 service in us-east-1 region

CloudFront Serving Multiple Buckets
Two buckets
s3://apptium-cf/apptium-file/apps.txt
s3://verizon-cf/verizon-file/db.txt

Now need to publish two buckets in on CF link
like 
https://cf-demo/apptium-file/apps.txt
https://cf-demo/verizon-file/db.txt



Step 1: Create a Cloud front distubution for single bucket (Bucket A)
Step 2: once Distribution is created move to that distribution by clicking on it
Step 3: Move to Origins tab -> Create Origin -> enter the new Bucket name to be pointed as-usual like default CF->Save
Step 4: now move to behaviour and add the behaviour
        path pattern => apptium-file/*
		orgin and orgin groups => Origin name(Bucket origin) as created in step 2
		Viewer protocol policy => Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
		under "Cache key and origin requests" (NOTE, This is for Object Cache in CloudFront)
		Select "Legacy cache settings"
		Set All fields to none
		under "Object caching"
		select "customize"
		set all the fields to zero
		
Now Do the same thing Ste 3 and Step 4 for the verizon-file 
As path pattern => verizon-file/*
	Done, Wait for deployment

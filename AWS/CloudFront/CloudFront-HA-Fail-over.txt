Cloud Front high Availability

To create a Failover scenario
ie; if one bucket fails Need to serve the content from another bucket

For Eg:
s3://primary-bucket/a1.txt
s3://secondary-bucket/a1.txt

If primary bucket fail, the content has to serve from secondary bucket
For this we have to create an Orgin Group

Step 1: login to cloud front
Step 2: Go to the distribution by clicking on it
Step 3: Go to origin->create origin group
Step 4: select the first origin to be primary
		Select the second origin to be secondary
		Give the Orgin name
		Click create origin group to save
Step 5: Go to Behaviour tab
		Select the Default behaviour Default(*) -> Edit
		choose the Orgin group name created in Step 4
		Save

To check the failover scenario, Go to primary bucket and change the file name
Then go to invalidation tab and invalidate the path /a1.txt

so on next request it directly take from S3 bucket instead of cache.

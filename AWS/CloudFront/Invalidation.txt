CloudFront Invalidation

If Cloudfront serves the content even if the content is updated in the s3
Then use the invalidation method which invalidate the cache content and servers directly from S3 on next request.
Step 1: Go to cloud front
Step 2: Click on Distribution
Step 3: Go to invalidation tab
		give the path to be invalidated
		/images/sch.txt
		/images/*
		
	Done


Another Method is "Cache-Busting"
This is much more cost-efficient than invalidation method
Example
if you have a file in bucket demo.txt, the next updated object can be demo_1.txt and another updated object can be demo_2.txt
So that based on query it will publish the data

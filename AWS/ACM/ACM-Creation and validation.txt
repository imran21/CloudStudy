ACM Certificate creation
TO create an ACM certificate you should have a domain name
Please Add the domain name with wild card EG: *.xo1.sg. Adding wild card url to DNS service provider will validate the domain so quickly
Select the DNS validation

Then click on request button.

Once CNAME has been created by the ACM for the respective url, Add those CNAME in DNS provider(godady or googleDNS)

Please refer the below URL for adding both CNAME and CNAME value in DNS provider(godady or googleDNS)

ACM with Google Domain
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63553661/validating-aws-certificate-in-google-domains

What domain is your cert registered for?

It looks like you are saying AWS said the record should be _XXXXXc0c9db9a6c9300e65f9XXXXXXXX.www.mydomainame.com which means _XXXXXc0c9db9a6c9300e65f9XXXXXXXX needs to be added as a record under the subdomain of www.mydomainame.com

You may be adding the record under mydomainname.com and not under the www subdomain which is may be why it's not working.

I would suggest recreate the ACM create and creating a wildcard cert under the top level domain (e.g. *.mydomainame.com).

ACM with godady

The Host will receive the AWS certificate manager's Name, BUT just the prefix, for example:

AWS name:

_904706782abb3d16301321f28db53e03.my-domain.com.
You should grab just this _904706782abb3d16301321f28db53e03 for godaddy's Host name. For the "points to" (on your GoDaddy account) input, you should grab the value of the AWS certificate manager. For example:

_0ba986089fff81c1b4f395a2ea75f42e.hkvuiqjoua.acm-validations.aws
By the way, the value comes with a dot at the end, GoDaddy will remove the dot at the moment you click enter. for example:

_0ba986089fff81c1b4f395a2ea75f42e.hkvuiqjoua.acm-validations.aws. will become to

_0ba986089fff81c1b4f395a2ea75f42e.hkvuiqjoua.acm-validations.aws

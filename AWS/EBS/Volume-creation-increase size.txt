EBS on Linux

#After attaching EBS on Linux machine need to do the following
#For accessing the new volume
Step 1: create an partition on the volume
		fdisk /dev/xvdf
		n
		p (primary)
		1
		ENTER
		ENTER
		W
		
Step 2: (you will get an partition xvdf1 - Do partition on that)
>sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf1
Step 3: 
>mkdir /ebs-data

Step 5:
> mount /dev/xvdf1 /ebs-data

if mkfs command not found then install the follwoing packages
sudo yum install xfsprogs
-----------------------------------

Troubleshoot
if you get Error on mkfs like 
mkfs.xfs:/dev/xvdg1 appears to contain a partition table (dos).
mkfs.xfs: Use the -f option to force overwrite.

then use the following command
>mkfs.xfs -f /dev/sdb1

-----------------------------------------

INCREASING THE VOLUME SIZE
once the volume size is increased in AWS GUI, Need to execute in linux console also with some command
xvdg    202:96   0  15G  0 disk
└─xvdg1 202:97   0  10G  0 part
if your partition is like this, then once your volume size is increased then execute the following command
>sudo growpart /dev/xvdg 1   ### where xvdg is the Disk volume name and '1' is partition ID mentioned as 'part'
After executing above commad you will get the lsbk as follwoing
xvdg    202:96   0  15G  0 disk
└─xvdg1 202:97   0  15G  0 part

KMS key sharing cross account
VPC pearing same account and cross account

Once the Key is created it can not be shared. The key has to be shared at the key creation time itself.
If you want to share the already existing key then we need to edit the Key policy of the particular key.

Let me explain to create key and share with another account
Step 1: Login to AWS KMS and click on Customer Managed Keys(CMK)
Step 2: Click on create key and choose Symmentric and choose KMS
Step 3: Enter the name of the Key in Alias field.
Step 4: Select the user to administrate the key.
        Here I will select the root user and any user name who can administrate.
Step 5: Again select user or role to manage the key 
        And Enter target account number in the below box(Add another AWS Account) for other accout users to access the key
		You will get an ARN of the Target account.
		If you want any specific user to access that key, you need to enter the specific ARN of that account users.
Step 6: On clicking on Next you will get the key Policy in JSON format. 
        You can add specific target account user ARN here.

            }
        }
    ]
}



On the Target account for the specificuser who want to access this CMKs, Add the below  IAM policy and attach to that particular user
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1621605712309",
            "Action": [
                "kms:Decrypt",
                "kms:DescribeKey",
                "kms:Encrypt",
                "kms:GenerateDataKey"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:ca-central-1:120763833592:key/be0c63dd-294a-4d7f-9b7b-ba5df4347b5a"
        }
    ]
}

Note: The above resource mention in the IAM on target account is the ARN of the CMKs created in source account.
Note: The above IAM can be created in AWS online policy generator

Once the above process is completed, we can able to search the source account CMKs in the target account.

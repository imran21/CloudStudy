AZURE LB- Rule Theory
Session presistance in azure LB rule is like session stickines in AWS LB
if you select 'None' it involves five tuples
	- Source Port
	- Destination Port
	- Protocol (TCP,UDP)
	- Source IP
	- Destination IP
NOTE: if you are selecting 'None' then you are disabling stickness, The traffic may go to any healthy VM. It will consider all the 5 tuples.

If you select Client IP then it is source affinity ie; 2 tuples	(Choose this for sticky session)
	- Source IP
	- Destination IP
Client IP (2-tuple) - Specifies that successive requests from the same client IP address will be handled by the same backend instance.

If you select 'Client IP and Protocol' then it is 3 tuples (Choose this for sticky session)
	- Protocol (TCP,UDP)
	- Source IP
	- Destination IP
Client IP and protocol (3-tuple) - Specifies that successive requests from the same client IP address and protocol combination will be handled by the same backend instance.

Azure Noraml LoadBalamcer stup steps
Step 1: create VPC-virtual-network and subnet
Step 2: Create Network security group(NSG)
Step 3: Attach NSG to pub-subnet
Step 4: Create 2 VM
			NOTE: Select 'Public inbound ports' to 'None'
				  Makesure NIC is disabled in network tab 'NIC network security group'
Step 4: Create a Load balancer and assign IP
		LB Tier: Regional
		LB SKU: Standard
		Tier	: Regional
		IMPORTANT NOTE: While creating public front-end IP address please select 'Internet' option. Then only it will able to communicate to internet
				
Step 5: Create backend-pool and attach backend VMs
Step 6: Create an Healthcheck probe
				Protocol: TCP
				Port: 80
Step 7: Create Loadbalancer Rule,
			Session presistent: None -> this option is not to specify stickiness in LB
			
Step 8: (Optional) Adding InBound NAT rule.
		Adding inbound NAT rule helps to communicate to VM individually (which is behind the Load balabcer) on different port through LB IP 
		Frontendport: Give any random port which shouldn't be configured configured in lb rules
		Back end port: Give port 22 if you want to connect to the VM through SSH
		
		Do the same thing for other VM as well. Do this individually for each VM by seleting Type=Azure Virtual Machine

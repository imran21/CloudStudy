Integrating Jfrog with Jenkins

Step 1: Install "Artifactory" plugin
Step 2: Now go to manage jenkins -> configure systems -> search for "Artifactory" or Jfrog
		In my case I am getting JFrog in my UI
		
Step 3: Proivde the following details
		Instance ID = Any Identification to be identified while creating job
		JFrog Platform URL = https://chennaicloud.jfrog.io
		Username = <created user>
		Username = <password>
		
		Now check for test connection it should reply "Found JFrog Artifactory 7.34.4 at https://chennaicloud.jfrog.io/artifactory"
		JFrog Distribution not found at https://chennaicloud.jfrog.io/distribution --> Need to check this later.

Step 4: Apply and Save.

	As the artifactory has to be pused to jfrog please do the post build action as described below.

Step 5: Post-build Actions dropdown -> select "Deploy artifacts to Artifactory"
		once the artifactory server endpoint is selected click on "Refresh Repository" button
		Once clicked,  the "Target snapshot repository" dropdown will list all repository in Jfrog.
		
Step 6: Apply and Save

Once build is success you can navigate to Jfrog Artifactory-> Artifacts -> <reponame> -> you can find the JAR here.

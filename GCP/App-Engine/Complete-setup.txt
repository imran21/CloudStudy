App Engine
Two types 
	Standard
	Flexiable
-Standard
	Run on the specic sandbox based on the language choosen
	Support two versions v1 and v2
	v1- old version of java python etc 
	v2- new version of java python,nodejs and many more language.
	Note: It support only manual, basic and Automatic scaling
-Flexiable (It is a advanced feature to run aplication on Container)
	Makes use of Virtual machine
	It runs application on the Container
	Support any language
	Provide access to VM to check process and can attach disk volume also.
	Note: It support only Manual and Automatic scaling

App Engine has three type of scalings
	Manual 
	Basic
	Automatic
	

-Automatic 
	Autoscal beased on CPU utilization, Throughput, Concurent request
	Should configure maximum and minimum instances
-Basic
	Instance are shutdown if zero request.
	Cost is low
	Experience low latency - So not feasible for high critical and fast rquest response applications
	So, It is not supported by App Engine Flexibility
	Configure Maximum instance and Idle Timeout
-Manual
	Adjust number of instan cemanual over time
	
---------------------------------------------
Before deploying need to create te following files
A Specific directory<nodejs-server> and under that
		app.yaml
        all your node packages and executables
content of app.yaml

	
	
---------------------------------------
gcloud config set project <current project-id>

Move to the specific directory which you want to deploy
>gcloud app deploy

To deploy to a specifie version
>gcloud app deploy --version=v2

To display URL of the deployed app
>gcloud app browse

To display the specific version of the deployed app
>gcloud app browse --version=<Version_ID or Version_Name>

To List the services
>gcloud app services list

To list the versions
>gcloud app versions list

To list the instnaces associated to this application
>gcloud app instances list

To deploy a new version(v3) but not send traffic to it.
New version will be deployed but no traffic will be send to it.
>gcloud app deploy --version=v3 --no-promote

The Reverse of above is 
>gcloud app deploy --version=v3 --promote
or Deploy it again
>gcloud app deploy --version=v3

To split the Trffic
>gcloud app services set-traffic --splits=v3=.5,v2=.5 

The Above command by default split traffic based on IP
To Split randomly on each versions
>gcloud app services set-traffic --splits=v3=.5,v2=.5 --split-by=random

To send all the trafic to v3 only
>gcloud app services set-traffic --splits=v3=1

https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/app/versions/delete
To delete a specific version of a specific service
>gcloud app versions delete --service=myService v1

To delete a named version across all services
>gcloud app versions delete v1

To delete multiple versions of a specific service
>gcloud app versions delete --service=myService v1 v2

To delete multiple named versions across all services
>gcloud app versions delete v1 v2

The versions to delete (optionally filtered by the --service flag).
FLAGS
--service=SERVICE, -s SERVICE
If above flag specified, only delete versions from the given service.

--------------------------------------------------------------

To link Appengine to Load balancer
NOTE: Only CLASSIC LOAD-BALANCER   will WORK

Cloud RUN in GCP
The Cloud run is the serverless container service
It runs the container with out any server support
Pay only for the number of request we make to the service

This demonstaration shows on how to launch a container on cloud run through CLI
Create an Dockerfile that you need to have all the functionalities
Build the dockerfile
Launch the docker file to the cloud run and it will create the container

Step 1: Create Docker file
Step 2: Build the docker file
		>docker build -t <image-name:tag> .
Step 3: Now tag the docker image specific to the project
		>docker tag <current-image-name:tag> gcr.io/<GCP-Project-id>/<image-name>:<tag>
		#Example: docker tag service-registry gcr.io/orbitera-282006/service-registry:1
Step 4: Now push the container to the google container registry(gcr)
		>docker push gcr.io/<gcp-project-id>/<image-name>:<tag>
		#Example: docker push gcr.io/orbitera-282006/service-registry:1
		
Step 5: Once the image has been pushed to gcr then execute the below script to launch container in cloud run
		>gcloud run deploy service-registry --image=gcr.io/orbitera-282006/service-registry:1 \
		--allow-unauthenticated \
		--platform=managed \
		--port=8761 \
		--cpu=2 \
		--memory=4192Mi \
		--region=us-east1 \
		--project=orbitera-282006
		
		Now, you will get an URL to the containeronce the above command is success.
		On hitting the URL from the browser you will get the Forbidden Error. To avoid this please follow the below steps
		
		Now, once the above script is success a URL will be gerenrated to access the container.
		To allow any user to have access to the URL(any user to ping from browser) need to assign permission
		Add "AllUsers" and assign "CloudRunInvoke" permission.
		
Note: Cloud run doesn't support volume mount but access to secret manager can be done

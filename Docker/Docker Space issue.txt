If you are getting docker space issue please configure the default docker directory to the root directory
Follow the following steps
Step 1: sudo systemctl stop docker
Step 2: sudo mv /var/lib/docker /docker-data
Step 3: sudo ln -s /docker-data/docker /var/lib/docker
Step 4: sudo systemctl start docker

This would be better if it done at the time of docker installation itself
Once docker has been installed before starting the docker the abovestepshas to be followed


IF Docker start not working the remove or backup /var/lib/docker

Docker ENV and ARG

ARG - During the build time -Image creation
ENV- During container creation

To check what env variable has set in container, Get into container and execute 'env' command

To pass env from CLI use -e flag

Example
>docker run -ti --name web1 -e HTTP_NAME="web1" -e HTTP_DEPT="Finance" centos:latest /bin/bash

We can also use env file for it like demovars.env
and use flag --env-file /path-to-env-file

NOTE: The env varaible can not be  passed to dockerfile from outside as file.

------------------------------
ARG - Pass argument during build time of image
To pass ARG on build time to docker file use the following inside docker file
ARG Name="default-value"
ENV Name=$ARG


Then in build command CLI use the following
>docker build -ti --name web1 --build-arg NAME=centos .

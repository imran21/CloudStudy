RUN vs CMD

CMD - 
	Execute any command on start of the container.
	NOTE: Can override the values by passing the values on start of the container
	if we have two CMD in the dockerfile it will take only the latest CMD in the last line on starting the container.
	The above CMD will be executed inside the container then ignored.
	
	Example
	CMD echo "Welcome to India" -> This is executed on intermediate container.
	CMD echo "Welcome to china" -> This is executed on start of the container.

	
ENTRYPOINT
	Work same as CMD but It cannot be override
	NOTE: It cannot be override by pasing new value on start of container
	It will get appended afert the entrypoint command
	
	We can use ENTRYPOINT and CMD in combination as sown below
	ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]
	CMD ["Hi Docker"]
	
	Now we can override the value on start of continaer just by pasing the value

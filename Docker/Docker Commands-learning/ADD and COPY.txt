Docker COPY and ADD

To copy the entier directory to the container use same dir name on both place
Example copy demo dir to container

COPY demo /any-dir/demo

ADD commad also do the same thning
but if we specify te tar file it will extract the file and put in target folder of the container

ADD xyz.tar /any-dir/extract-files

And if we give only link of tar-file to the ADD command it will download and put the tar file to target
This wont untar and put in target
